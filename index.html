  <h3>My first webpage</h3>
  <p>This was the very <strong>first project</strong> I ever did, It ws fun to do and a new experience. I used HTML and CSS to create it, you can take a look at it <a href="https://justinsospeter.github.io/My-first-webpage/">HERE</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>A mysterious girraffe</h3>
    <p>This was also on the first day but after having learnt a few tricks about css styling with classes so  it was a little better to look at. 
    <h3>About me</h3>
